    "text": "A growing focus of my research is the quantum dynamics of molecules at very low temperatures, often in the presence of external fields. Recent years have witnessed incredible progress in cooling and trapping molecules, which hold huge potential for quantum simulation, quantum computing, and precision tests of physics beyond the Standard Model. My experience centers on prospects for cooling chemically stable species like molecular hydrogen, which present different challenges than more typical ultracold molecules like bialkalis.\n\nCryogenic Spectroscopy of H₂\nMy first steps into the cold regime involved the collisional perturbation of optical resonances in a cryogenic environment. From a fundamental perspective, spectroscopy of cold molecules is beneficial because low temperatures suppress Doppler broadening. This was the primary motivation behind recent work on a new cryogenic setup used to measure molecular hydrogen spectra [1].\nAt cryogenic conditions (~5K), the entire population of molecular hydrogen collapses into its ground rovibrational state. This work reported the most accurate Doppler-limited measurement of H₂ to date, allowing us to probe QED corrections to an unprecedented level. My role was to provide reference line-shape parameters that minimized systematic errors in fitting the cryogenic spectra. This setup also opens the door to probing other interesting cold H₂ physics, including shape resonances, which can be traced via spectroscopy.\n\n\nTrapping Molecular Hydrogen\nThe next frontier for H₂ is trapping. I am currently contributing to the ERC Starting Grant H2TRAP project (PI: Piotr Wcisło), which aims to trap the H₂ molecule using strong external fields. My work involves providing realistic estimates for the depth of potential optical dipole and magnetic traps and analyzing the mechanics of loading H₂ molecules into them.\nA key challenge in precision spectroscopy of trapped particles is the differential Stark shift: the ground and excited states of a molecule experience slightly different light shifts from the trapping laser. This leads to inhomogeneous broadening of the spectral line. To address this, we have proposed an analogue of the atomic “magic wavelength” for molecular hydrogen, associated with weak electric quadrupole transitions in the infrared. This concept, detailed in [2], brings hope for performing accurate spectroscopy of H₂ in optical dipole traps.\n\n\nSympathetic Cooling of H₂ with Lithium\nTo push H₂ into the ultracold regime, we have also explored the feasibility of sympathetic cooling—using collisions with another species that is already ultracold. Given its similar mass, we considered sympathetically cooling H₂ with atomic lithium. In collaboration with Timur V. Tscherbul’s group at the University of Nevada, Reno, we performed rigorous coupled-channel calculations for the Li-H₂ system, including hyperfine and magnetic field couplings. This work, described in [3], is a crucial theoretical step toward realizing this cooling scheme.\n\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\n[1] K.

    "section": "",
    "text": "A central theme of my work is understanding how collisions between particles perturb a molecule’s spectrum. In the simplest picture, collisions cause a spectral line to broaden and shift, resulting in a Lorentzian shape. In reality, this is just one piece of the puzzle. The thermal motion of molecules also causes Doppler broadening, and a widely-used approach that combines these two statistically independent effects leads to the common Voigt profile.\nHowever, for applications in remote sensing, high-precision laboratory science, and astrophysics, the Voigt profile is often insufficient. A series of more subtle phenomena, collectively referred to as beyond-Voigt effects, become important. These include fascinating effects like the Dicke narrowing of spectral lines or inhomogeneous broadening caused by the speed-dependence of collisional shifting [1]."

    "section": "Interpreting high-resolution spectra",
    "text": "Interpreting high-resolution spectra\nBeyond-Voigt effects pose a serious challenge for interpreting experimental spectra. While many phenomenological line-shape models exist, several different models can often fit an observed spectrum equally well, hindering a clear physical interpretation.\nFortunately, it’s possible to compute the entire spectral line shape from first principles. Building on foundational work in quantum kinetic theory, a robust theoretical framework now exists [2], [3], [4], [5]. This framework connects the complex collision operator, which governs the line shape, directly to the scattering S-matrix—a quantity that can be calculated using time-independent quantum scattering theory.\nThis provides a powerful pathway: we can generate reference line-shape parameters from first principles, without adjusting any parameters to match experiments. My work focuses on providing these reference parameters for atmospherically and astrophysically relevant systems, enabling more accurate analysis of spectra and contributing to large databases like HITRAN."

    "text": "From theory to practice: the BIGOS code\nThe process begins with an ab initio potential energy surface (PES) for a given scattering system and involves solving the close-coupling equations of quantum scattering. While working in Piotr Wcisło’s group, I contributed to the first benchmark calculations for H₂-He and HD-He, which led to the first purely ab initio database of collisional line-shape parameters [6], [7].\nAs we expanded this work to atmospherically-relevant molecules at room temperature, we quickly hit the limits of computational feasibility [8]. To tackle this complexity and experiment with more efficient methods, our group developed our own quantum scattering code: BIGOS.\nThe heart of the package, SCATTERING, solves the close-coupling equations in the body-fixed frame of reference [9], [10]. This, along with features like dynamic memory allocation, allowed us to push the boundaries of what was possible. In the following years, our group successfully tackled O₂-perturbed transitions in CO [11] and HCl [12], and N₂-perturbed transitions in O₂ [13], all with remarkable agreement with experimental data. We are currently working on a more user-friendly Python version of the package."

Experimental validation of these calculations not only tests QED but can also be used to constrain beyond-Standard-Model physics. My work has provided reference line-shape parameters for H₂ and its isotopologues, ensuring that collisional effects do not limit the accuracy of these fundamental experiments [14], [15], [16], [17].\nExotic Helium Atoms: Another fascinating application is in the spectroscopy of exotic helium atoms, where an electron is replaced by a heavier particle, such as an antiproton. Accurate spectroscopy of antiprotonic helium is used to determine the antiproton-to-electron mass ratio, which provides a stringent test of the fundamental Charge, Parity, and Time (CPT) symmetry of the Standard Model.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFunded Research: PRELUDIUM Grant\n\n\n\nThese exotic atoms are studied in helium buffers, meaning their spectra also suffer from collision-induced shifts and broadenings.

    "text": "The Motivation: A High-Precision Puzzle\nThis topic gained my attention following the incredible progress in high-precision spectroscopy of molecular hydrogen over the last decade. The problem came to a head in 2018, when research groups in Amsterdam and Hefei independently measured the same rovibrational transition in the deuterated hydrogen isotopologue, HD [1], [2].\nIntriguingly, their results for the transition frequency differed by nearly ten times the combined experimental uncertainty. This sparked a discussion about the possible origins of the discrepancy. A key question emerged regarding the experimental treatment of the unresolved hyperfine structure of the transition, as the spectral line widths were already on the same order as the expected hyperfine splittings."

This work produced the first complete theoretical dataset for the hyperfine structure of hydrogen. The data allows experimentalists to reduce systematic errors in measurements that test molecular quantum electrodynamics (QED) and search for new physics beyond the Standard Model.\nThis theoretical work was recently put to the test and confirmed by the Amsterdam group. First, they detected an isolated hyperfine component in the tritiated isotopologue, HT, whose favorable structure features a single strong component set apart from the others [8]. More recently, they resolved the individual hyperfine components of a transition in the H₂ molecule itself, finding them spread symmetrically around the line center [9]."
