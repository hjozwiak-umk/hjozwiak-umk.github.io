I'm a theoretical and computational physicist with a focus on spectroscopy and collisional dynamics. I use first-principles quantum scattering calculations to investigate collisions and interactions between simple atoms and molecules. The goal of my work is to provide ultra-accurate theoretical data that supports high-precision experiments and contributes to astrophysical and atmospheric models.
